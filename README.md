# Pendo Product Analytics Certification Course
Notes for Pendo Product Analytics Certification Course

## About this course
Product managers (PMs) have historically relied on gut feel to make decisions. 
They’d talk to a handful of customers, hear feedback and requests internally, and then decide what to prioritize. 
Although this operating model is still in practice, the best PMs are turning to quantitative data to **bolster qualitative feedback**, 
**uncover insights** about their users, and guide **decision making**. 
This course will dive deep into the foundations of product analytics methodology, use cases, and its place within a wider business strategy.

**Time commitment:** 3 hours
